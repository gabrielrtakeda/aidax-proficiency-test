Getting Started
===============

Skills required
---------------

To configure FinalBoard you will need basic HTML and JavaScript/JSON skills.

The more advanced widgets you want to create, the more advanced JavaScript skills can be required.

FinalBoard dashboards are built on `Bootstrap3 <http://getbootstrap.com>`_ and `AngularJS <http://getbootstrap.com>`_. Therefore for more advanced widgets it is good to have some Bootstrap3 and AngularJS templating syntax experience.


Requirements
------------

FinalBoard dashboards are 100% client side, which means you can use any modern internet browser to display FinalBoard dashboards.

The only requirement is web-server to server static JS/CSS/HTML files.


First run
---------

Unzip archive and copy whole package to directory which is served by any web-server and open destination URL in you browser.

Voil√†! The example dashboard should running. And you should see something like this: http://finalboard.com/demo/
